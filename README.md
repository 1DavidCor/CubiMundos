# CubiMundos
KU CubeWorlds, ahora disponibles en espa√±ol.

The KU CubeWorlds series takes maps of planets, moons, and other objects and transforms them into cubes. These CubeWorlds are available in a simple cut/paste version and a slightly more complicated origami version. Find the original English series at: https://astro.ku.edu/cubeworlds/

These fun, crafty cubes make a great planet-themed activity for classrooms, museums, and libraries. Or, you can use them as neat handouts for your next astronomy outreach event.

In this repository, you can find the Spanish "CubiMundos" along with assembly instructions and unique descriptions written by yours truly, David R. Coria.
